# Portfolio

This repository hosts my software engineering portfolio and resume. I am a full‑stack developer based in Rosh Ha'ayin, Israel, with experience in Spring Boot, Java, JavaScript and database technologies.

## Featured Project: Spring Boot Product Management

This project implements a simple product management API using Spring Boot. It demonstrates a clean layered architecture, CRUD operations, interactive API documentation and containerised deployment.

- **RESTful API** for managing products (list, create, read, update and delete)
- **Layered architecture** using controllers, services and repositories with DTOs
- **Swagger UI** for interactive API documentation
- **Docker Compose** for running the Spring Boot application and a PostgreSQL database
- **Integration testing** using Testcontainers

You can view the project source code here: <https://github.com/BD-Ali/spring-boot-product-management>
